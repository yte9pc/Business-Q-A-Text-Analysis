# Exploratory Analysis of Technology and Telecommunication Transcript
Sentiment analysis and topic modeling of 4 Networking/Telecommunications company
Many companies keep transcripts of conferences, tech talks, and quarterly earning calls
between company management, industry competitors, and analysts. These transcripts contain
useful information that can provide insight into business decisions, performance, and industry
competitors. However, reading numerous transcripts manually can be difficult and timeconsuming.
To aid businesses, I aim at using a transcript dataset containing 1,401 transcripts to
derive trends and common topics within these companies. The transcript dataset consists of
companies like Cisco, Intel, IBM, and Verizon transcripts, from 2002 through 2017.
